What are the benefits of implementing Machine Learning?\\nAutomatic and real-time leakage detection\\nIncreased efficiency and accuracy compared to manual methods\\nMinimizing defective products and reducing production costs 10 What Data Needed to Build Machine Learning Model? Sensor Data and preprocessing Techniques Required Data Types: Datetime → Timestamp from start to end while production process\\nTemperature Sensor → Detects temperature changes that may affect packaging\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nClassification Data → Labels data for product condition (whether it is leaking or not) (yes/no) Data Preprocessing Steps: Data Collection\\nData Normalization\\nFeatures Extraction\\nSplitting data for training and testing (80% training, 20% testing) 12 Production pipeline 13  Sensor A = 2\\nSensor B = 6\\nSensor C = 9 BOCOR?
